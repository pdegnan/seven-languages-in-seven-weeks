# Installing Prolog
Note: the Prolog community is divided into a set of armed camps.  For the purposes of this group, we should use GnuProlog so we're on the same version. 
- PC: http://gprolog.univ-paris1.fr/
- Mac: MacPorts and HomeBrew both have GnuProlog installers
- Linux - Debian & Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install gprolog

# Sublime
- SublimeLinter has Ruby support and SublimeText has basic Ruby support out of the box
